      <h1>Introduction to Discovering Exoplanets</h1>
      <h2>Learning Objective:</h2>
      <p class="float-left">To understand why finding exoplanets is difficult and to introduce the main methods used,
       focusing on the Transit Method.</p>

      <h3>1- What are Exoplanets?</h3>
      <p class="float-left">Exoplanets are planets that orbit a star outside of our Solar System.
        The search for exoplanets is the search for new worlds, possibly habitable ones.</p>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <h3>Looking for Indirect Signs!</h3>
      <p>Solution: Look for Indirect Effects Since we cannot see the planet directly, we look for changes in the star‚Äôs behavior caused by the planet's gravity or orbit. The planet leaves a "signature" on its star.</p>
      <h3>2- The Challenge of Finding Them</h3>
      <p>The Challenge: Why Can't We See Them?<br> 1. Distance: They are incredibly far away.<br> 2. Brightness: They are tiny and dark compared to their stars.
       <br>>The star‚Äôs light completely overwhelms the faint light reflected by the planet.</p>
      <h3>Two Key Detection Methods:</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/l-1.3.png" alt="Exoplanets" class="lecture-img-full border-radius  ">
      <h3>The Transit Method</h3>
      <p>The Concept: If the planet‚Äôs orbit is aligned with our view, it briefly blocks a fraction of the starlight. <br>Why it Matters for Data Science: <br>1. Data Source: This method produces "Light Curves"‚Äîperfect time-series data for analysis
      <br>2. Model Training: This data is essential for training Machine Learning models to automatically identify exoplanets in vast amounts of telescope observations</p>

      <h1>What is a Light Curve?</h1>
      <h2>Learning Objective:</h2>
      <p>1. Learn what a light curve is and why it‚Äôs important in astronomy.<br>
       2. See how the curve‚Äôs shape tells us when a planet passes in front of a star.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a Light Curve?</h3> 
      <p>A light curve is like a star‚Äôs ‚Äústory in a graph.‚Äù
      It shows how the brightness of a star changes over time.
      <br>‚Ä¢	If the star is calm, the curve is almost a straight line.
      <br>‚Ä¢	If something happens (like a planet crossing in front of the star), the curve shows a dip.
      </p>
      <h3>How does a transit look?</h3>
      <p>When a planet moves in front of the star:
      <br>‚Ä¢	The curve goes<b> down suddenly </b>(the star looks dimmer).
      <br>‚Ä¢	It stays<b> flat at the bottom </b>while the planet is blocking the star.
      <br>‚Ä¢	Then the curve goes<b> back up quickly </b>when the planet moves away.
      <br>This makes a shape like a<b> ‚ÄúU‚Äù </b>or a little<b> bowl</b>, and that‚Äôs the signal that a planet is there.</p>
      <img src="/assets/img/l-2.1.png" alt="Exoplanets" class="border-radius">
      <h3>Think of it like this:</h3>
      <p>Imagine a bright lamp. If you move a small coin in front of it for a moment, the lamp looks a little dimmer. The light curve is just the graph that shows this small change.
      <br>In this picture:
      <br>‚Ä¢	The star = the lamp.
      <br>‚Ä¢	The planet = the coin.

      <h1>What is a Transit and How Do We Use It?</h1>
      <h2>Learning Objective:</h2>
      <p>1. Understand what a transit is in astronomy.
      <br>2. Learn how transits help us discover and study planets.</p>
      <h3>What is a Transit (Astronomical Transit)?</h3> 
      <p>A<b> transit </b>happens when a smaller object (like a planet) passes in front of a larger one (like a star).
      From Earth, it looks like a tiny dark spot moving across the star‚Äôs face.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Example in our Solar System: </b> Mercury or Venus passing in front of the Sun when they line up with Earth and the Sun.
      <img src="assets/img/l-3.1.png" alt="Exoplanets" class="border-radius">
      <h3>Why is Transit Important?</h3>
      <p>Transits are one of the most powerful tools in modern astronomy. They help scientists to:
      <br>‚Ä¢<b>	Discover exoplanets:</b> When a planet crosses in front of its star, the star looks a little dimmer. Measuring this dip confirms the presence of a planet.
      <br>‚Ä¢	<b>Measure planet size & orbit:</b> The depth of the dip tells us how big the planet is, and the duration & repetition of the dip reveal its orbit and distance from the star.
      <br>‚Ä¢	<b>Study atmospheres: </b>During transit, some starlight passes through the planet‚Äôs atmosphere. By analyzing this light, scientists can detect gases like water vapor or methane ‚Äî clues to whether the planet could be habitable.
      <br>‚Ä¢	<b>Historical importance: </b>In the 18th and 19th centuries, observing Venus transits helped astronomers calculate the distance between Earth and the Sun (the Astronomical Unit).

      <h3>Analogy:</h3>
      <p>Imagine a big lamp and you move a small coin across it. The lamp looks slightly dimmer while the coin is in front. That‚Äôs exactly what happens during a transit!</p>

      <h1>Measuring Planet Properties from a Light Curve</h1>
      <h2>Learning Objective:</h2>
      <p>1. Understand how the three main measurements from a light curve (Depth, Period, Duration) reveal the discovered planet‚Äôs properties.<br>
       2. Learn what each property means and how it relates to orbit and size.
      </p>
      <h3>1. How Do We ‚ÄúDraw‚Äù a Planet?</h3> 
      <p>A light curve is not just proof of a planet‚Äôs existence ‚Äî it is also a precise measuring tool.
      By analyzing<b> three key dimensions of</b> the curve, astronomers can build a complete picture of the exoplanet:
      <b><br>‚Ä¢	Depth
      <br>‚Ä¢	Period
      <br>‚Ä¢	Duration</b>
      </p>
      <h3>2. First Property: Planet Size (Depth)</h3>
      <p><b>‚Ä¢ Definition: </b>The depth is the amount of decrease in the star‚Äôs brightness.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Meaning: </b>It shows the planet‚Äôs size compared to the star.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Rule: </b>The larger the planet, the more light it blocks ‚Üí the deeper the dip.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Conclusion: </b>Measuring depth helps determine the planet‚Äôs radius (its size).
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Analogy:</b> If a small tennis ball passes in front of the Sun, the brightness drop is tiny. If a giant like Jupiter crosses, the dip is much bigger.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Second Property: Planet‚Äôs Year (Period)</h3>
      <p><b>‚Ä¢ Definition: </b>The period is the time between two successive transits of the same planet.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Meaning: </b>This period is the planet‚Äôs orbital year ‚Äî how long it takes to complete one orbit around its star
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Rule: </b>Shorter period ‚Üí closer orbit. Longer period ‚Üí farther orbit.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Conclusion: </b>Measuring the period helps determine how far the planet is from its star and how long its year is.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Analogy:</b> Like a racetrack ‚Äî a car on the inner circle comes back quickly (short period), while a car on the outer circle takes longer (long period).
      </p>

      <h3>4. Third Property: Orbit Inclination (Duration)</h3>
      <p><b>‚Ä¢ Definition: </b>Duration is the total time the planet takes to pass in front of the star (from start of dip to end).
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Meaning: </b>It relates to the planet‚Äôs speed and the tilt of its orbit during transit.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Rule: </b>Shorter duration may mean the planet passed quickly or only across the edge of the star, while longer duration could mean a slower orbit or a central crossing.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Conclusion: </b>Duration helps astronomers model the orbit‚Äôs geometry and confirm data accuracy.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Analogy:</b> A car passing straight across your field of view takes longer (long duration). A car speeding across just the edge takes less time (short duration).

      <h3>5. Real Examples (Kepler Planets)</h3>
      <img src="assets/img/l-4.2.jpg" alt="Exoplanets" class="border-radius">
      <p><b>‚Ä¢	Kepler-4b:</b> Shows a shallow dip ‚Üí small planet size.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Kepler-4b & 6b:</b> Both have very short orbital periods (~3.2 days) ‚Üí very close to their stars.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Kepler-5b & 8b:</b> Show deeper dips ‚Üí larger planets, blocking more starlight.
      <br><b>‚Ä¢	Kepler-7b: </b>Longer period (4.9 days) ‚Üí farther orbit than the others.
      <br><b>Observation:</b>Most light curves have similar widths ‚Üí meaning these planets have comparable orbital speeds or transit paths.
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/img/l-4.4.jpg" alt="Exoplanets" class="border-radius">
      <h3>‚ú® Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>
      Depth = planet size üåç
      <br>Period = orbit distance & year ü™ê
      <br>Duration = orbit tilt & speed üöÄ
      <br>Together, they allow astronomers to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù a planet from just a dip in light.
